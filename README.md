# The Python Launcher for Unix

Launch your Python interpreter the lazy/smart way!

This project is an implementation of the `py` command for Unix-based platforms
(with some potential experimentation for good measure ðŸ˜‰).

The goal is to have `py` become the cross-platform command that Python users
typically use to launch an interpreter while doing development. By having a
command that is version-agnostic when it comes to Python, it side-steps
the "what should the `python` command point to?" debate by clearly specifying
that upfront (i.e. the newest version of Python that can be found). This also
unifies the suggested command to document for launching Python on both Windows
as Unix as `py` has existed as the preferred
[command on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher)
since 2012 with the release of Python 3.3.

Typical usage would be:

```
py -m venv .venv
py ...  # Whatever you would normally use `python` for during development.
```

This creates a virtual environment in a `.venv` directory using the latest
version of Python installed. Subsequent uses of `py` will then use that virtual
environment as long as it is in the current (or higher) directory; no
environment activation required (although the Python Launcher supports activated
environments as well)!

A non-goal of this project is to become the way to launch the Python
interpreter _all the time_. If you know the exact interpreter you want to launch
then you should launch it directly; same goes for when you have
requirements on the type of interpreter you want (e.g. 32-bit, framework build
on macOS, etc.). The Python Launcher should be viewed as a tool of convenience,
not necessity.

## Installation

There are various ways to install the Python Launcher for Unix. Some will
install the extras provided by this project while others will not. Specifically,
those extras are:

- The [man page](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher/blob/main/docs/man-page/py.1.md)
- Shell completions for [fish](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher/blob/main/completions/py.fish)
- This [README](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher/blob/main/README.md)

### Via `cargo`

If you have the latest stable
[release of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed, then you
can install the [Python Launcher via crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/python-launcher):

```
cargo install python-launcher
```

If you get a compilation error then it's very likely you don't have the latest
stable release of Rust as there is a
[release every 6 weeks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0507-release-channels.md)
and this project tracks Rust's stable channel closely.

Do note that this will **not** install things such as shell completions, the man
page, etc.

### From a `.tar.xz` file

If you go to the
[releases page](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher/releases) you will
find various `.tar.xz` files for each release that target various platforms. If
one is available for your platform then you can download the tarball and install
it into e.g. `/usr/local/` via:

```
tar --extract --strip-components 1 --directory /usr/local --file <tarball>
```

You can use `tar -t -f <tarball>` to see what files are included and where they
will be installed (e.g. man page, shell completions, etc.).

If you don't want to install the tarball then you can extract the tarball
and copy the files manually as desired; the `py` binary is self-contained and is
not dependent on any other files from the tarball.

### From [source](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher/)

This is equivalent to installing via crates.io (i.e. no extras are installed).

#### Using [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)

```
cargo install --path .
```

#### Using [`doit`](https://pydoit.org/)

[Doit](https://pydoit.org/) will only perform an installation if source code as
changed since the last time you used the `install` command:

```
doit install
```

## Documentation

The general control flow for finding the appropriate Python executable is the
following (with Python 3.6, Python 3, and the newest version of Python installed
as examples):

See the
[man page](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher/blob/main/docs/man-page/py.1.md)
or the top section of `py --help` for more details.

## FAQ

### How do I have [Starship](https://starship.rs/) use the Python Launcher to display the Python version?

Add the following to your [Starship configuration file](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/completions.html#where-to-put-completions):

```TOML
[python]
python_binary = ["py"]
# The following isn't necessary, but convenient.
detect_folders = [".venv"]
```

<img width="630" alt="starship_prompt" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54418/113020490-807f7e80-9137-11eb-8cf6-69a953017e39.png">

By using the Launcher with Starship, your prompt will tell you which Python
version will be used if you run `py`. Since the Launcher supports virtual
environments, the prompt will properly reflect both what global install of
Python will be used, but also the local virtual environment.

### How do I get a table of Python executables in [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)?

```sh
py --list | lines | split column "â”‚" version executable | str trim
```

Do note that the character that is being split on is **not** the traditional
[U+007C/"Vertical Line"/pipe character](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+007C) (`|`),
but [U+2502/"Box Drawings Light Vertical"](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2502) (`â”‚`).

### How can I make Python Launcher use my default Python version from pyenv?

If you're using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage your Python
versions, you'll want to grab the major and minor version from the first Python
version listed in your default
[pyenv version file](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#choosing-the-python-version).

If you're using a `~/.pyenv/version` file to store pyenv's global Python
versions, you can add this line to your `.zshrc` or `bashrc` file:

```sh
export PY_PYTHON=$(head -n 1 $(pyenv root)/version | cut -d "." -f 1,2)
```

Or this line in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file:

```sh
set -gx PY_PYTHON (head -n 1 (pyenv root)/version | cut -d "." -f 1,2)
```
