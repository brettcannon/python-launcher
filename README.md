# The Python Launcher for Unix

An implementation of the `py` command for Unix-based platforms
(with some potential experimentation for good measure ðŸ˜‰)

The goal is to have `py` become the cross-platform command that Python users
typically use to launch an interpreter. By having a command that is
version-agnostic command when it comes to Python, it side-steps the "what should
the `python` command point to?" debate by clearly specifying that upfront (i.e.
the newest version of Python that can be found). This also unifies the suggested
command to document for launching Python on both Windows as Unix as `py` has
existed as the preferred
[command on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher)
since 2012 with the release of Python 3.3.

A non-goal of this project is to become the way to launch the Python
interpreter _all the time_. If you know the exact interpreter you want to launch
then you should launch it directly; same goes for when you have
requirements on the type of interpreter you want (e.g. 32-bit, framework build
on macOS, etc.). The Python Launcher should be viewed as a tool of convenience,
not necessity.

For instructions on how to use the Python Launcher, see the top section of
`py --help`.

## Installation

You can either install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or from source.
Both approaches require you install the Rust toolchain. You can use
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to accomplish this or whatever your OS suggests.

If you want to
[install from crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/python-launcher), run:

```shell
cargo install python-launcher
```

If you want to install from source, run:

```shell
cargo install --path .
```

## Search order

Please note that while searching, the search for a Python version can become
more specific. This leads to a switch in the search algorithm to the one most
appropriate to the specificity of the version.

You can always run the Python Launcher with `PYLAUNCH_DEBUG` set to some value
to have it output logging details of how it is performing its search.

### `py -3.6` (specific version)

1. Search `PATH` for `python3.6`

### `py -3` (loose/major version)

1. Check for the `PY_PYTHON3` environment variable, and if defined
   and not the empty string then use it as the specific version
   (e.g. `PY_PYTHON3=3.6`)
1. Search `PATH` for all instances of `python3.*`
1. Find the executable with the newest version number that comes earliest on
   `PATH`

### `py` (any version)

1. Use `${VIRTUAL_ENV}/bin/python` immediately if available
1. Use `.venv/bin/python` immediately if available
1. If the first argument is a file path ...
   1. Check for a shebang
   1. If shebang path starts with `/usr/bin/python`, `/usr/local/bin/python`,
      `/usr/bin/env python` or `python`, proceed based on the version found
      on that path
      (bare `python` is considered the equivalent of not specifying a
      Python version)
1. Check for the `PY_PYTHON` environment variable, and if defined then use it
   as the loose or specific version (e.g. `PY_PYTHON=3` or `PY_PYTHON=3.6`)
1. Search `PATH` for all instances of `python*.*`
1. Find the executable with the newest version that is earliest on `PATH`
