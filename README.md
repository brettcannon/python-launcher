# The Python Launcher for Unix

https://python-launcher.app is the full documentation for this project.

## Motivation

Launch your Python interpreter the lazy/smart way!

This project is an implementation of the `py` command for Unix-based platforms
(with some potential experimentation for good measure ðŸ˜‰).

## Example

Typical usage would be:

```
py -m venv .venv
py ...  # Normal `python` usage.
```

This creates a virtual environment in a `.venv` directory using the latest
version of Python installed. Subsequent uses of `py` will then use that virtual
environment as long as it is in the current (or higher) directory; no
environment activation required (although the Python Launcher supports activated
environments as well)!
